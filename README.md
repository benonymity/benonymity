## I'm Ben

I like code (especially Python), selfhosting, learning, Minecraft development, and plenty more. I'm writing this to procrastinate on another project. I don't think I'll make most of my projects public, so sorry. But I like to star things, so I suppose I should make my account *slightly* more interesting.
