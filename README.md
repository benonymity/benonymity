## I'm Ben

I like code (especially Python), selfhosting, learning, Minecraft development, and plenty more. I'm writing this to procrastinate on another project. I don't think I'll make most of my projects public, so sorry. But I like to star things, so I suppose I should make my account *slightly* more interesting.

**Opinions**:
- Dark theme always
- Markdown, and hence Obsidian, are the best
- Dell servers are noisy
- TBs are awesome
- FOSS is better
- MacOS is superior (for most things, don't @ me)
- Matrix is the best communication platform
- Security is to be striven for
- Pursuing Truth, Goodness, and Beauty
- Oh yeah, I like Shakespeare too.
- Though Harry Potter is the best book series. Literary alchemy, anyone?
- And piano is perfect
- And music is mind-tickling
- And audiobooks are awe-inspiring
- Okay, my alliteration algorithim is actually awful!
- I like lots of things actually
- Classical is the best method of education
- Everything has a Wordview!
- Don't doxx me
- ^ That is not a challenge btw
- Awesome lists are truly awesome
- I dislike java
- I love Python
- VS Code code-server is how I write code
- Docker is INCREDIBLE!!
- Proxmox is also wonderful
- And r/selfhosted in invaluable
- I am running out of random facts
- And it is late
- So I should go to bed
- Maybe I'll add more later
- G'night
